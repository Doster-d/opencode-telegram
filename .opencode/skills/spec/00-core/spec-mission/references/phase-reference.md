# Mission Phase Reference

## Quick Reference: When to Use Each Phase

| Phase | Trigger | Skip When |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 0. Recon | Always first | Never skip |
| 1. Spec | New feature, behavior change | Pure refactor with no behavior change |
| 2. Gap Analysis | After spec, before coding | Trivial change |
| 3. BDD | Feature with user-facing behavior | Internal utility only |
| 4. TDD | All implementation | Spike/prototype (delete after) |
| 5. Verify | Before any merge/commit | Never skip |
| 6. Audit | Before merge to main | Quick fix in non-critical area |
| 7. Error KB | Bug found during work | No errors encountered |
| 8. Git Commit | Always | Never skip |
| 9. Release | Production deployment | Development branch only |

## Domain Loading Decision Tree

```
Is this an ML/AI project?
├─ Yes → skill_use "theta-ml-research"
└─ No → Continue

Is this a web frontend project?
├─ Yes → skill_use "theta-web" (when available)
└─ No → Continue

Is this security-sensitive?
├─ Yes → skill_use "theta-security" (when available)
└─ No → Continue with core skills only
```

## Adapting for Task Size

### Trivial Fix (< 30 min)
```
Recon (5 min) → TDD → Verify → Commit
```

### Small Feature (1-4 hours)
```
Recon → Spec (light) → BDD → TDD → Verify → Audit → Commit
```

### Medium Feature (1-3 days)
```
Full pipeline, all phases
```

### Large Feature (> 3 days)
```
Full pipeline + break into multiple PRs
Each PR follows: BDD → TDD → Verify → Audit → Commit
```
